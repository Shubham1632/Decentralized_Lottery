# Decentralized Lottery System

This project is a decentralizedÂ lottery system built on the Ethereum blockchain. In this case, I used the Chainlink oracle's random number generator function. Because the project is built with these features, no user can tamper with the lottery system's results or the selection of a winner. The project can be used to run transparent and fair lottery trials.
